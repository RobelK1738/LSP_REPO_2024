Design and code a program that reads a text file, and counts the number of times each word that it contains appears.
The code you write should handle various scenarios, such as case sensitivity and ignoring punctuation.
For instance, words like 'Design', 'design', and 'DESIGN' should be considered the same word.
This test file also includes some trivial words such as 'and', 'the', 'it', and 'a', which should be ignored.
Another thing to note is that numbers like 100 or 123 should not be counted as words.
